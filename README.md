Hi! Here is my submission for the GL Education technical task. I haven't had a lot of time to spend on it in the last couple of days, and as such have only completed about half of the work.

I generally follow Robert C. Martin's school of thought, that the code itself should be the primary documentation. Comments are often unnecessary and confuse things, or go stale when the code is changed. For a project as simple as this, I think the code more than speaks for itself. 

Being on a new laptop, I had a bit of a faff getting Node.js and Angular set up. I'll complete the Angular web app for my own sake, but I suppose my work will have to be judged without it. Thanks.
